In this capstone, the goal was to see if SpaceX's Falcon 9 is worth investing in. Space X costs $62 million per launch as opposed to competitors' launches that cost upwards of $165 million. This cost is because Space X is able to reuse the first stage. 
To see if worth investing, I performed web scraping to access the data, EDA to find the most important features that impact the landing, visualization to showcase the findings and ML algorithms to predict the chance of landing successfully given that data.
